Demos for CircuitPython Workshop

Demo projects are as follows:

Demo 1-0: Bouncing Microchip "Meatball" logo around TFT display  
Demo 1-1: Using IMU accelerometer data to move "Meatball" around TFT display  
Demo 1-2: Using IMU gyroscope data to move "Meatball" around TFT display  
Demo 1-3: Get compass heading from IMU magnetometer using Kalman filters and vector addition  
Demo 2-0: Simple LCD Terminal  
Demo 2-1: BME680 (Temp, Hum, Press, Gas) displayed on LCD terminal  
Demo 2-2: BME680 (Temp, Hum, Press, Gas) displayed on LCD using colored lables according to set thresholds  
Demo 2-3: BME680 (Temp, Hum, Press, Gas) displayed on LCD using colored lables according to set thresholds, and setting threshold colors on NeoPixels  
Demo 3-0: APDS9960 (proximity, gesture, color): Proximity displayed on LCD terminal  
Demo 3-1: APDS9960 (proximity, gesture, color): Gesture displayed on LCD terminal  
Demo 3-2: APDS9960 (proximity, gesture, color): Gesture mapped to WAV files  
Demo 3-3: APDS9960 (proximity, gesture, color): Color measurement taken with RGB values displayed on LCD and color reproduced on NeoPixels  
Demo 3-4: APDS9960 (proximity, gesture, color): Gesture mapped to audio tone, as a simple digital "Theremin"  

Over time more project demos will be added.
